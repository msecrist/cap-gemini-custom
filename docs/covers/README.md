# Covers and Other Pages for Course Materials

The files in here are:

  * blank - "This page deliberately left blank"
  * copyright-slide - for student handout PDF
  * copyright - for lab-docs and printed handout
  * course-cover - for printed handout
  * handouts-cover - for student-handout PDF
  * labs-cover - for lab-notes PDF
  
These files can be in Open Office Impress (odp) or MS Office PowerPoint (ppt)
document format.   They will be converted to PDF by the build.

MS Office PowerPoint pptx files are not supported because the PDF conversion
software (from Open Office) still can't handle them.
